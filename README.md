## Overview

The dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption per household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. The data was donated on August 30, 2012 by Georges Hebrail, who is a Senior Researcher at EDF located in France, and is available at the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. This archive contains 2,075,259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months).

## Variable Descriptions

- Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
- Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
- Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
- Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
- Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
